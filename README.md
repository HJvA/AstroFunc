# HastroFunc


HastroFunc is a computer program for symbian smart phones to compute properties of celestial bodies

<p>For nokia S60 3rd edition phones with python v1.4.5 ( python can be retrieved from: <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pys60">sourceforge.net/projects/pys60</A> )
<br/>Matrix library derived from 'mathguide' developed by Hartmut Ring</p>

<p>HastroFunc is a program to calculate positions of celestial bodies like sun,moon,planets,stars. It uses the newest standards for celestial mechanics as published by the IAU (precession,nutation,frame). For moon position it uses a reduced ELP solution, and for sun,planets positions it uses a Keplerian elements solution.
